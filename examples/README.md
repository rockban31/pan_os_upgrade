## üìä Example Comparison

| Feature | Single Firewall | Batch Panorama |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Devices** | 1 | Multiple (typically 5-50) |
| **Complexity** | Low | High |
| **Duration** | 1-2 hours | 4-8 hours |
| **Downtime** | 5-10 minutes | 5-10 min per device |
| **Monitoring** | Manual | Automated |
| **Rollback** | Manual | Automated options |
| **Reporting** | Basic | Comprehensive |
| **Concurrency** | N/A | 3-10 simultaneous |

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Guidelines

### Always Follow These Steps
1. **Test in Lab First**: Never run directly in production
2. **Use Dry-Run Mode**: Verify actions before execution
3. **Backup Everything**: Configuration, settings, documentation
4. **Plan Rollback**: Have reversion procedures ready
5. **Monitor Closely**: Watch for issues during upgrade
6. **Validate Results**: Confirm successful completion

### Risk Mitigation
- **Maintenance Windows**: Schedule during low-usage periods
- **Communication Plan**: Notify stakeholders of activities
- **Emergency Contacts**: Have support resources available
- **Console Access**: Ensure out-of-band management available
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of all changes

## üîß Customization Tips

### Adapting Examples to Your Environment

#### Network Addresses
```yaml
# Update inventory.yaml with your networks
firewalls:
  - hostname: your-firewall.company.com
    ip: 10.1.1.100  # Your management IP
    username: admin  # Your admin username
```

#### Timing and Concurrency
```yaml
# Update settings.yaml for your requirements
concurrency: 2  # Start conservative
retry_count: 5  # Increase for unstable networks
post_reboot_wait_seconds: 600  # Adjust for device speed
```

#### Backup Locations
```yaml
# Ensure backup paths exist and have space
backup_location: "/path/to/your/backups"  # Unix/Linux
backup_location: "C:\\backups"            # Windows
```

## üìà Performance Expectations

### Single Firewall Upgrade Timeline
```
Pre-flight checks:     5-10 minutes
Configuration backup:  2-5 minutes
PAN-OS download:      10-30 minutes (depends on connection)
Installation:         15-30 minutes
Reboot and startup:   5-15 minutes
Post-verification:    5-10 minutes
